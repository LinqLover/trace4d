abstract = {Software visualization uses metaphors to depict software system and software development data that usually has no inherent gestalt. The choice of a fitting metaphor for visual display is researched broadly, but deriving a layout based on similarity is still challenging. We present a novel approach to 3D software visualization called Software Galaxy. Our layout is based on applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation on source code documents. We utilize a metaphor inspired from astronomy for depicting software metrics for single documents and clusters of documents. Our first experiments indicate that a 3D visualization capturing semantic relatedness can be beneficial for standard program comprehension tasks.},

The layouts are computed by the iterative relaxation of Voronoi tessellations. Additionally, we describe techniques that allow the user to investigate software metric data of complex systems by utilizing transparencies in combination with interactive zooming.},

abstract = {Despite the progress that has been made in the field of program visualization, programmers nowadays still rely on in-serting extra code (e.g., print statements) to visualize complicated program states during debugging. Only recently have tools such as DDD (Data Display Debugger) (5) begun to provide visualization of data types for programmers. Still such visualization remains limited. There are many obstacles that have impeded and continue to impede program visualization for practical use. One such major obstacle one is the wide variety of data types in a computer program. Given the variety and complexity of computations for many domains, it is unlikely that visualizations will be available a priori to cover everything that might be interesting. As an attempt to address the problem, a debugging visualization tool called xDIVA is presented. The visual effects of xDIVA use 3-D shapes, colors, and animations from a 3-D rendering engine. xDIVA conducts a novel and meticulous object-oriented design so that visualization metaphors are interactive, composable, and decoupled from data, i.e. a complicated visualization metaphor can be composed and assembled from basic ones, each of which is independently replaceable. The benefits of xDIVA are demonstrated by several applications.},

abstract = {Continued development and maintenance of software requires understanding its design and behavior. Software at runtime creates a complex network of call--callee relationships that are hard to determine but that developers need to understand to optimize software performance. Existing tools typically focus on static aspects (e.g., Structure101 or SonarQube), or they are difficult to use and require high expertise (e.g., software profiling tools).Unfortunately, these dependencies are hard to derive from static code analysis: For one, static analysis will reveal potential call--callee relationships not actual ones. Second, they are often difficult to detect, since information systems today increasingly use abstraction patterns and code injection, which obscures runtime behavior.In this paper, we present our efforts towards accessible and informative means of visualizing software runtime processes. We designed a novel visualization approach that utilizes a hierarchical and interactive 3-D city layout based on force-directed graphs to display the runtime structure of an application. This promises to reduce the time and effort invested in debugging programming errors or in finding bottlenecks of software performance. Our approach extends the city metaphor for translating programmatic relationships into accessible 3D visualizations. With the identified goals and constraints in mind, we designed a novel visual debugging system, which maps programming code structures to 3D city layouts based on force-directed graphs. Exploration of the animated visualization allows the user to investigate not only the static relationships of large software projects but also its dynamic runtime behavior.We conducted a formative evaluation of the approach with a preliminary version of a prototype. In a series of six interviews with experts in software development and dynamic analysis, we were able to confirm that the approach is useful and supports identifying bottlenecks. The interviews raised and prioritized potential future improvements, several of which we implemented into the final version of our prototype.},

The main contributions of JIVE are: multiple concurrent representations of program state and execution history; support for forward and reverse execution; and graphical queries over program execution. This model facilitates program understanding and interactive debugging. Our visualization of runtime states clarifies the important point that objects are environments of execution. The history of object interaction is displayed via sequence diagrams, and in this way we help close the loop between design-time and run-time representations. Interactive execution is made possible by maintaining a runtime history database, which may be queried for information on variable behavior, method executions, and object interactions. We illustrate the capabilities of this system through examples. JIVE is implemented using the Java Platform Debugger Architecture and supports the Java language and libraries, including multithreaded and GUI applications.},

abstract = "Exploring an unfamiliar large-scale software system is challenging especially when based solely on source code. While software visualizations help in gaining an overview of a system, they generally neglect architecture knowledge in their representations, e.g., by arranging elements along package structures rather than functional components or locking users in a specific abstraction level only slightly above the source code. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach for software architecture recovery and use its results in an immersive 3D virtual reality software visualization to aid accessing and relating architecture knowledge. We further provide a semantic zoom that allows a user to access and relate information both horizontally on the same abstraction level, e.g., by following method calls, and vertically across different abstraction levels, e.g., from a member to its parent class. We evaluate our contribution in a controlled experiment contrasting the usefulness regarding software exploration and comprehension of our concepts with those of the established CityVR visualization and the Eclipse IDE.",

abstract = {The analysis of large execution traces is almost impossible without efficient tool support. Lately, there has been an increase in the number of tools for analyzing traces generated from object-oriented systems. This interest has been driven by the fact that polymorphism and dynamic binding pose serious limitations to static analysis. However, most of the techniques supported by existing tools are found in the context of very specific visualization schemes, which makes them hard to reuse. It is also very common to have two different tools implement the same techniques using different terminology. This appears to result from the absence of a common framework for trace analysis approaches. This paper presents the state of the art in the area of trace analysis. We do this by analyzing the techniques that are supported by eight trace exploration tools. We also discuss their advantages and limitations and how they can be improved.},

abstract = {Software visualizations can provide a concise overview of a complex software system.Unfortunately, since software has no physical shape, there is no ``natural'' mapping of software to a two-dimensional space. As a consequence most visualizations tend to use a layout in which position and distance have no meaning, and consequently layout typical diverges from one visualization to another.We propose a consistent layout for software maps in which the position of a software artifact reflects its vocabulary, and distance corresponds to similarity of vocabulary.We use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to map software artifacts to a vector space, and then use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to map this vector space down to two dimensions.The resulting consistent layout allows us to develop a variety of thematic software maps that express very different aspects of software while making it easy to compare them.The approach is especially suitable for comparing views of evolving software, since the vocabulary of software artifacts tends to be stable over time.},

abstract = {Object orientation has changed software development for the better, but it has not really made programs easier to understand. Object-oriented program analysis tools remain rare because OO concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism render conventional analysis and presentation techniques insufficient. The authors describe a way to obtain, manipulate, and visualize OO execution traces that provides fine-grained localization information for program understanding. Applying dynamic analysis along with interactive visualization makes it possible to determine the exact program paths that influence particular objects and facilitates recognition of execution patterns. Because an object can invoke methods in itself and in other objects, an interaction graph becomes an important tool for modeling object interaction. However, even small toy programs may produce so many invocations that the interaction graph becomes unmanageable. The solution is to use search-space-reducing techniques such as merging, pruning, and slicing to remove unwanted information from the interaction graph, thereby limiting its complexity and size. The research prototype Program Explorer takes a user through a series of executions and visualizations to explain a given program and its framework. Although it was originally designed for C++, a version developed for IBM's System Object Model demonstrated that the concepts are applicable to OO languages in general. The authors believe Program Explorer can be applied to a wide range of software engineering problems, such as framework understanding to improve reuse, application logic analysis for maintenance, and visual debugging of OO code.},

The key feature of Jeliot is the fully or semi-automatic visualization of the data and control flows. The development process of Jeliot has been research-oriented, meaning that all the different versions have had their own research agenda rising from the design of the previous version and their empirical evaluations. In this process, the user interface and visualization has evolved to better suit the targeted audience, which in the case of Jeliot 3, is novice programmers. In this paper we explain the model for the system and introduce the features of the user interface and visualization engine. Moreover, we have developed an intermediate language that is used to decouple the interpretation of the program from its visualization. This has led to a modular design that permits both internal and external extensibility.},

abstract = {We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.},

This paper describes a visualization data model and its implementation that accomplishes this. The model starts with program events that can be instrumented efficiently and with little overhead. It uses extended finite state automata to model program behaviors in terms of events. It builds time-varying data structures based on these automata. The data structures are then made available to various visualizations through a set of mappings that let the user dynamically control the visualization. The model and its implementation have been demonstrated on a range of specific understanding problems with a variety of different visualizations.},

There is a growing impedance mismatch between data size/complexity and the human ability to understand and interact with data. Visual analytic tools are intended to help reduce that impedance mismatch by using analytic tools to reduce the amount of data that must be viewed, and visualization tools to help understand the patterns and relationships in the reduced data. But visual analytic tools must address a variety of scalability issues if they are to succeed. In this paper, we characterize the scalability and complexity issues in visual analytics.

abstract = {Abstract Shimba is a reverse engineering environment to support the understanding of Java software systems. Shimba integrates the Rigi and SCED tools to analyze and visualize the static and dynamic aspects of a subject system. The static software artifacts and their dependencies are extracted from Java byte code and viewed as directed graphs using the Rigi reverse engineering environment. The run-time information is generated by running the target software under a customized SDK debugger. The generated information is viewed as sequence diagrams using the SCED tool. In SCED, statechart diagrams can be synthesized automatically from sequence diagrams, allowing the user to investigate the overall run-time behavior of objects in the target system. Shimba provides facilities to manage the different diagrams and to trace artifacts and relations across views. In Shimba, SCED sequence diagrams are used to slice the static dependency graphs produced by Rigi. In turn, Rigi graphs are used to guide the generation of SCED sequence diagrams and to raise their level of abstraction. We show how the information exchange among the views enables goal-driven reverse engineering tasks and aids the overall understanding of the target software system. The FUJABA software system serves as a case study to illustrate and validate the Shimba reverse engineering environment. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
